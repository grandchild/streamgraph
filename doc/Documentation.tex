\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} StreamGraph project aims to present the language
simplified in a graphical environment. As such it is intended to be used by
people who have little programming experience or do not wish to engage with the
specifics of the StreamIt language and alleviates the amount of StreamIt
specific semantic knowledge needed. StreamGraph does not contain every construct
or possibility that StreamIt provides since it does not aim to rebuild the
language in a graphical environment.



\subsection{StreamIt Language}
\noindent StreamIt is a language specifically build for applications which
process a continuous stream of data. To achieve good performance on multi-core
or multi-processor machines StreamIt enables highly parallel programming and
programs, while trying to keep the programming as simple as possible.\\

The language features specific basic modules. This documentation focuses on the
StreamGraph project and so only the subset of StreamIt modules which are
realized in StreamGraph today are included and briefly explained. For further
documentation on StreamIt see \cite{streamIt}.\\

The most basic module of the StreamIt language and the only module that
processes data is the filter. A filter, just as any other StreamIt construct,
has exactly one input and exactly one output for data. It consists mainly of a
work and an init function. The init function describes the filter's initial
condition (e.g. initial values of variables). The work function describes the
steps taken in one execution step of the filter and is called every time that
the preconditions are fulfilled.\\

These preconditions are described by the pop, peek and push values. The pop
value describes how many data packages are taken from the input of the filter in
a single execution step of the work function. Similarly the pop value describes
how many data packages are produced in the output of the filter in that
execution step. The peek value describes how far back the filter needs to read
in the input data, i.e. the minimum input queue length, since any value read has
to be processed to by previous filters.


\subsubsection{StreamIt topology}
\label{StreamItTopology}
\noindent Since filters alone do not specify in which order and if they are
connected it is necessary to have language constructs which describe the
connections and the structure of the processing. These constructs will be
referred to as topological construct in the further documentation.\\

One of these constructs is the pipeline. A pipeline connects filters, pipelines
and split-join constructs in a linear fashion. Each pipline has an init function
in which the elements of the pipeline are added and which determines the order
in which a datapacket is processed.\\
\\

The second construct supported by StreamGraph is the split-join construct. This
constucts splits the datapackets of its input to multiple data paths on which
other constructs are placed and joins these paths together at the end of every
path. All in all a split-join construct has exactly one input and one output.\\
\\

\noindent The StreamIt language generates a pipeline based structure. As such
it is not possible to connect two filters or constructs in different pipelines (see Fig. 
\ref{fig_StreamIt_topology}.).\\

	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{StreamItTopology}
	\caption{Example for a non permissable connection between pipelines}
	\label{fig_StreamIt_topology}
\end{figure}
\noindent Since split-join constructs have exactly one input and one output and only appear in pairs it is not
 possible to have connections from one split-join pair to another pair(see Fig. 
 \ref{fig_StreamIt_topology_between_SJ}) or to have an unequal numbers of splits and joins (see Fig. 
 \ref{fig_StreamIt_topology_missing_join}).\\

\subsection{Model}

\subsection{Graph hierarchy}

StreamGraph introduces subgraphs as a new feature for compartmentalization of
code. Subgraphs act like normal filter nodes in the parent graph, but are
actually a pipeline. This makes use of the fact that pipelines and filters can
be used in the same context in StreamIt, namely in other pipelines and in
split-join constructs.


\subsection{GraphCompat}

\noindent The StreamIt topology, as discussed in \ref{StreamItTopology}, is not
only a directed Graph but has additional restrictions. Some of these are not
strictly necessary and some effort was made in StreamGraph to allow for graphs
that are not strictly StreamIt-compatible and then automatically convert them.

This task is taken on by the GraphCompat class. It transforms a given
StreamGraph graph, coming from the user interface, into a new graph which
is compatible with the StreamIt topology.

At the moment it takes care of the following 3 transformations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sources and Sinks

  A StreamIt graph must start and end with exactly one void-typed input and
  output respectively. StreamGraph also makes the void-typed requirement but
  does not restrict the graph to just one source and one sink. Multiple sources
  and sinks are combined by adding "Void Sources" and "Void Sinks" to the ends
  of the graph when necessary.\\

\item Identities

  StreamIt does not allow direct connections between a split and a join without
  a filter or a pipeline. In StreamGraph such a connection is allowed. In this
  case GraphCompat adds an identity filter instead of the direct connection
  between the split and the join, as can be seen in Fig.
  \ref{fig_split_join_identity}. This filter copies his input to his output
  without changing the content in any way.\\

\item Subgraphs

  Subgraphs as they are, are a feature of StreamGraph, and don't make use of
  StreamIt's joint-compilation features. It essentially does the same though, by
  flattening the graph hierarchy into one single graph.\\

\end{itemize}



\begin{figure*}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{SplitJoinIdentity}
	\caption{Example of adding an identity filter}
	\label{fig_split_join_identity}
\end{figure*}
\noindent The Streamgraph infrastructure allows a graph with multiple sources
and sinks if the sources all have a void input and the sinks all have a void
output type. In that case the GraphCompat class adds a void split/start or
respectively a void join/end to ensure the StreamIt restriction that every
construct has exactly one input and one output, as long as adding these does not
violate the other rules of StreamIt. An example can be viewed in Fig.
\ref{fig_void_end}. The addition of void-starts/splits is handled in an
equivalent manner.\\
\begin{figure*}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{VoidEnd}
	\caption{Example of adding a void-end}
	\label{fig_void_end}
\end{figure*}



\subsection{CodeObject}
\noindent The CodeObject is an interface class which is extended by the Pipeline
class, the SplitJoin class and the Parameter class. It is a general class for
all implemented topological constructs of the StreamIt language. Filters are not
CodeObjects since they do not describe the structure of the graph but rather are
the nodes of the Graph.\\
While Parameters also do not describe the structure of the graph, they may be
needed by multiple CodeObjects and are needed in different configurations while
the code is generated. As such the parameters are an exception to the general
rule that CodeObjects describe the structure of the graph. CodeObjects except
for parameters reference to other CodeObjects or filters. As such a single
CodeObject can have an entire graph ready for code generation stored in a manner
that already has the necessary order and hierarchical structure of a StreamIt
program.


\subsubsection{Parameter}
\noindent The Parameter class is an approximation of the way parameters are
handled in the StreamIt language. Parameters are an exception in the sense that
they are not topological constructs. In the visible graph they are represented
by nodes. Parameters do not reference other CodeObjects or filters. They only
are referenced from other objects (filters or CodeObjects). Every parameter as a
CodeObject exists exactly once.\\
For better readability in the StreamIt source file the parameters are written as
global variables in the main pipeline and are passed through to the other code
objects.\\


\subsubsection{Pipeline}
\noindent Every StreamIt program contains at least one pipeline, the main
pipeline, in which all other constructs and filters are
placed. A pipeline CodeObject has an array which stores the objects in order.
These objects may be other CodeObjects like split-join constructs or filters. If
the need for a split-join construct is detected while creating the pipeline a
split-join construct is created. When the creation is complete the pipeline continues its
creation and eventually returns.\\


\subsubsection{SplitJoin}
\noindent Split-join constructs are the most obvious parallel construct in the
StreamIt language. A split-join construct has at least two parallel paths. Every
path in a split-join is modeled as a pipeline. As such when a split-join is
created for every path the creation of a pipeline is started. In StreamIt it is
not necessary to create a pipeline if there is exactly one filter on a path
between a split-join pair. StreamGraph creates a pipeline on every path of a
split-join pair for the sake of convenience. The approach to generate a
pipeline in every case should not increase the execution time significantly and
does not change the order of execution. Because of this reasons it was decided
to not include the feature to only create pipelines in split-join constructs 
when strictly necessary.\\



\subsection{Code generation}
\noindent The code generation as a first step generates the code for every
filter in the graph. This is made possible, because filters are the basic
modules of StreamIt and due to the fact that every meaningful StreamIt program
has at least a Pipeline.  As such StreamIt as a language does not allow programs
consisting only of filters because without a pipeline no connection between
these filters can be made (see \ref{StreamItTopology} for further
explanation).\\
After generating all filters the code generation continues with the main
CodeObject which is a pipeline. While generating the code of a topological
construct (a pipeline or a split-join-pair) it may be necessary to generate the
code of another such topological construct since it is a part of the first
construct. In that case the code generation of the current construct is paused
and the code generation of the contained construct is started. By the time the
code generation of the contained construct is finished the code generation of
the containing construct is continued.\\
The code generation arranges filters and topological constructs according to
their type. Thus a StreamGraph output file first lists all filters, then all
pipelines and last all split-join constructs.\\
