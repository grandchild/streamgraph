=head1 NAME

StreamGraph::View::ItemHotSpot - Manage a "hot spot" on a view item.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes StreamGraph::View::ItemHotSpot version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

use StreamGraph::View::ItemHotSpot;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Four StreamGraph::View::ItemHotSpots are created for each
StreamGraph::View::Item. The hotspots are areas on the mind map,
that when clicked, cause an action to be performed on an item. These
hotspots allow the user to expand/collapse the items in the mind map,
or to resize an item.


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 Properties

=over

=item C<item> (StreamGraph::View::Item)

The item that this hotspot belongs to.

=item C<enabled>

If true, the toggle is receiving events and may act on them. Otherwise
it is not receiving events.

=item C<fill_color_gdk> (Gtk2::Gdk::Color)

The color with which to fill the toggle.

=item C<outline_color_gdk> (Gtk2::Gdk::Color)

The color with which to fill in the hotspot outline. Toggles normally
have a visible outline, while grips usually have the outline set to
the same color as the item fill color.

=item C<hotspot_color_gdk> (Gtk2::Gdk::Color)

The color of the hotspot once it is engaged. A hotspot becomes engaged
when the mouse is placed close to it.

event occurs.
