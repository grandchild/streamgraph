=head1 NAME

StreamGraph::View::Border::Rectangle: Create a rectangular border.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes StreamGraph::View::Border::Rectangle
version 0.0.1

=head1 HEIRARCHY

 StreamGraph::View::Border
 +----StreamGraph::View::Border::Rectangle

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use StreamGraph::View::Border::Rectangle;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is internal to StreamGraph::View. It draws a
rectangular border for a StreamGraph::View::Item. This rectangle
is instantiated as part of the item creation process in
StreamGraph::View::ItemFactory.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Properties

=over

=item 'content' (StreamGraph::View::Content)

The content to be placed in the border.

=item 'x' (double)

The x-coordinate of the upper left corner of the border bounding box.

=item 'y' (double)

The y-coordinate of the upper left corner of the border bounding box.

=item 'width' (double)

The width of the border bounding box.

=item 'height' (double)

The height of the border bounding box.

=item 'width-pixels' (double)

The width of the border line (in pixels).

=item 'padding-pixels' (double)

The spacing between the content and the border (in pixels).

=back

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<new(group=E<gt>$group, content=E<gt>$content, ...)>

Instantiate a rectangular border. You must provide the
Gnome2::Canvas::Group on which this border is to place itself. You
must also provide a content object, StreamGraph::View::Content.

=item C<border_get_image>

This method overrides the border_get_image method defined in
Border.pm. It instantiates a Gnome2::Canvas::Rect.

=item C<border_set_x>

This method overrides the border_set_x method defined in Border.pm. It
sets the value of the border x1 coordinate, and adjusts the x2 value
so that the border retains it's width.

=item C<border_set_y>

This method overrides the border_set_y method defined in Border.pm. It
sets the value of the border y1 coordinate, and adjusts the y2 value
so that the border retains it's height.

=item C<border_set_width>

This method overrides the border_set_width method defined in
Border.pm. It sets the value of the border x2 coordinate to reflect
the new width.

=item C<border_set_height>

This method overrides the border_set_height method defined in
Border.pm. It sets the value of the border y2 coordinate to reflect
the new height.

=item C<border_set_param>

This method overrides the border_set_param method defined in
Border.pm. It sets parameters in the Gnome2::Canvas::Rect object
instantiated by this module.
